## What is the complexity of your algorithm ?

    There is 2 loops for(going trough each vessel) + while(searching for valid coordinates)
    
## How would you improve your algorithm ?

    The switch can be replaced by an array and a loop, each part could actually be refactored into methods/functions

## How would your adapt your algorithm to three dimensions ? How would that affect the complexity ?

    It add a 3rd level in $arrayMap and more combinations in the switch
